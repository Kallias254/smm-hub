# Implementation Roadmap: The Build Plan

**Phase 1: The Core (Days 1-3) - ✅ COMPLETED**
*   Initialize Payload CMS v3 (Blank Starter).
*   Setup PostgreSQL database.
*   Define Core Collections: `Tenants`, `Users`, `Posts`, `Media`.
*   Implement Multi-tenancy access control hooks.

**Phase 2: The Creative Engine (Days 4-7) - ✅ COMPLETED**
*   Install `@vercel/satori` and `fluent-ffmpeg`.
*   Create the `media-processing` Job Queue.
*   Build the "Real Estate Template 01" in Satori.
*   Test flow: Upload Image -> Auto-generate Branded Version.
*   **Status:** Templates built, Tasks implemented, Build errors resolved.

**Phase 3: The Distribution Pipe (Days 8-10) - 🚧 IN PROGRESS**
*   Deploy Postiz (Docker).
*   Connect Payload to Postiz API.
*   Implement `distribution` Job Queue (Stubbed in `publishToPostizTask`).
*   Test automated posting to a dummy Facebook Page.

**Phase 4: The Mobile Bridge (Days 11-14) - ⏳ PENDING**
*   Scaffold Flutter App (Basic structure exists).
*   Implement Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
*   Build the "Share Intent" logic.
*   Connect "Confirm Post" button to Payload API.

**Phase 5: Monetization & Polish (Days 15+) - ⏳ PENDING**
*   Integrate Daraja API (STK Push).
*   Build the "Dashboard" (Payload Custom Views for Analytics).
*   **Pannellum Integration:** Add the 360 viewer custom component to the Admin UI.

## Specific Answers to Architect's Questions

### 1. The Dashboard: Payload or Mantine?
**Stick to Payload.**
*   Payload v3 is built on Next.js App Router. You can create completely custom pages at `/admin/dashboard` or `/admin/analytics`.
*   You can import any React library (Recharts for graphs, Mantine for widgets) *inside* these custom views.
*   Building an external dashboard creates a "Dual Truth" problem and doubles your security surface area. Keep it monolithic for the Hub.

### 2. Pano API: Pannellum vs. Outsourced
**Use Pannellum (Local).**
*   **Cost:** Free.
*   **Speed:** Instant (no upload/processing lag).
*   **Complexity:** Low. It's just a React component wrapping a WebGL viewer.
*   **Outsourcing:** Only necessary if you need "Dollhouse" views (Matterport style) or automated stitching of bad photos. For standard 360 equirectangular images, local rendering is the seasoned choice.
